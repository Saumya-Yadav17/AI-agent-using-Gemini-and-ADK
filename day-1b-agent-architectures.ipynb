Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model.

The output of one agent automatically becomes the input for the next, creating a predictable and reliable workflow.\n\n**Use Sequential when:** Order matters, you need a linear pipeline, or each step builds on the previous one.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [sequential agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Blog Post Creation Pipeline**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"User Input: Blog about AI\"] -- > B[\"Outline Agent\"]\n    B -- >|blog_outline| C[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    C -- >|blog_draft| D[\"Editor Agent\"]\n    D -- >|final_blog| E[\"Output\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ffcccc\n    style C fill:#ccffcc\n    style D fill:#ccccff\n```\n-->","metadata":{"_uuid":"5c1063a7-9bab-4a99-99bc-e65cbddc5875","_cell_guid":"a3b57c44-05a5-40c7-9127-82a38d3f3b2b","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"1000\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/sequential-agent.png\" alt=\"Sequential Agent\" />","metadata":{"_uuid":"b27c56b1-5128-4e69-8e16-a947f2246e75","_cell_guid":"0d15038b-1c76-4563-b684-8d1ecca57361","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1 Example: Blog Post Creation with Sequential Agents\n\nLet's build a system with three specialized agents:\n\n1. **Outline Agent** - Creates a blog outline for a given topic\n2. **Writer Agent** - Writes a blog post\n3. **Editor Agent** - Edits a blog post draft for clarity and structure","metadata":{"_uuid":"ea7ce829-7215-4eb2-9ea3-ad3ae23bc57f","_cell_guid":"f1500c87-8902-4391-a7a2-6cb47e5dbc5c","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"id":"h6Bcds7EBtHE","jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Outline Agent: Creates the initial blog post outline.\noutline_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"OutlineAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Create a blog outline for the given topic with:\n    1.

What if you could delegate tasks, collaborate more effectively, and build more robust systems by harnessing the power of intelligent, independent agents working together? Get ready to discover how Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are not just a theoretical concept, but a practical game-changer for developers.\n\n**Main Sections:**\n\n**1. What Exactly *Are* Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)?**\n\n*   **The Collective Intelligence:** Imagine a team of specialized digital assistants, each with its own goals, knowledge, and ability to communicate and cooperate. That's the essence of MAS.\n*   **Beyond Monolithic Code:** MAS breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable units (agents) that can operate autonomously, making your software more modular and easier to scale.\n*   **The \"Smart\" in Software:** These aren't just simple scripts; agents can learn, adapt, and make decisions based on their environment and interactions with other agents.\n\n**2. The Developer's Toolkit: Unpacking the Benefits of MAS**\n\n*   **Enhanced Problem Solving & Scalability:** Divide and conquer becomes a reality. Complex challenges can be tackled by multiple agents working in parallel, drastically improving processing power and the ability to handle growing demands.\n*   **Increased Robustness & Resilience:** If one agent fails, the system doesn't necessarily collapse. The distributed nature of MAS allows for graceful degradation and self-healing capabilities, making your applications more reliable.\n*   **Simplified Development & Maintenance:** Instead of managing one giant, intricate codebase, you're dealing with smaller, more focused agent modules. This leads to clearer code, easier debugging, and faster iteration cycles.\n\n**3. Real-World Applications: Where MAS is Already Shining**\n\n*   **Intelligent Automation & Robotics:** From autonomous vehicles to smart factories, MAS is the backbone of systems that require coordinated decision-making and action in dynamic environments.\n*   **Complex Simulations & Modeling:** Researchers and businesses use MAS to model intricate systems like financial markets, biological processes, or traffic flow, allowing for deeper insights and predictions.\n*   **Smart Grids & Resource Management:** Optimizing energy distribution, managing supply chains, and coordinating complex logistical operations are prime examples of MAS efficiency in action.\n\n**4. Getting Started: Your First Steps into the Agent World**\n\n*   **Understanding Agent Architectures:** Explore common MAS paradigms like BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) or reactive agents to grasp the foundational concepts.\n*   **Leveraging MAS Frameworks:** Discover powerful tools and libraries (e.g., JADE, SPADE, AgentPy) that simplify the creation and deployment of agent-based systems.\n*   **Thinking in Agents:** Cultivate a new mindset for problem-solving, shifting from a single, imperative approach to a more distributed, declarative way of thinking about software design.\n\n**Concluding Thought:** Multi-Agent Systems aren't just a futuristic concept; they are a powerful paradigm shift that empowers developers to build smarter, more resilient, and more scalable software. By embracing the \"pack mentality\" of intelligent agents, you can unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation in your development projects.\nWriterAgent > ## Unleash Your Development Superpowers with Multi-Agent Systems!\n\nEver feel like you're drowning in complexity, juggling countless tasks in software development? What if there was a way to delegate, collaborate, and build more robust systems by tapping into the collective intelligence of specialized digital assistants? Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a paradigm shift that's transforming how we build software.\n\nAt its core, MAS involves a team of intelligent, independent agents, each with its own goals, knowledge, and communication abilities. Think of them as highly skilled digital collaborators. This approach breaks free from the constraints of monolithic code, offering a modular, scalable solution. These aren't just simple scripts; MAS agents can learn, adapt, and make decisions, injecting true \"smartness\" into your applications.\n\nThe benefits for developers are immense. MAS fundamentally enhances problem-solving and scalability by allowing complex challenges to be divided and conquered by agents working in parallel. This boosts processing power and ensures your applications can handle growing demands. Furthermore, MAS dramatically increases robustness. If one agent encounters an issue, the system can often continue functioning, providing graceful degradation and self-healing capabilities. Development and maintenance become a breeze too; managing smaller, focused agent modules is far simpler than navigating a single, massive codebase, leading to clearer code, easier debugging, and faster iteration.\n\nFrom autonomous vehicles and smart factories to intricate financial simulations and optimized smart grids, MAS is already powering cutting-edge applications. Ready to dive in? Explore agent architectures like BDI, leverage powerful frameworks like JADE or AgentPy, and start thinking in agents.

For fifty years, the same sea spray, the same rhythmic beam cutting through the fog. But tonight, a faint, otherworldly glow pulsed from a rolled parchment tucked behind a loose stone. Unfurling it revealed a map, not of any coastline he knew, but of stars. Strange constellations, nebulae like spilled ink, and a single, shimmering destination marked with an 'X'. It wasn't drawn with ink, but with light itself, each line a thread of phosphorescence. A tremor, not of the sea, but of wonder, ran through him. The stars called, not from above, but from within this impossible chart.\nCriticAgent > This is a very strong start to a story! The imagery is evocative, and the premise is intriguing.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Expand on Elias's reaction and inner thoughts:** While the \"tremor of wonder\" is a good start, delve deeper into what this discovery means to Elias. After fifty years of routine, how does this fantastical map shatter his worldview? Does he feel fear, excitement, a sense of purpose, or something else entirely? Showing more of his internal processing will make him a more relatable and compelling character.\n\n2.  **Hint at the origin or purpose of the map:** The map is described as \"otherworldly\" and drawn with light. Consider adding a subtle clue about where it might have come from or what its purpose might be. Is it a guide, a warning, or a summons? Even a single, ambiguous detail could add another layer of mystery and hook the reader.\n\n3.  **Introduce a hint of the next step or conflict:** The story ends with Elias contemplating the map. To make it feel more like a complete, albeit short, narrative, you could add a brief indication of what he might do next, or the immediate challenge this discovery presents. For example, does the lighthouse itself react in some way to the map? Does he feel an urge to decipher it or seek out the 'X'?\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-worn grooves of the lighthouse lantern room, a ritual as ingrained as the tide. For fifty years, the same sea spray had kissed his weathered face, the same rhythmic beam had sliced through the fog, a dependable heartbeat in the vast indifference of the ocean. But tonight, the familiar hum of the lamp was underscored by a faint, otherworldly glow. It pulsed from a rolled parchment tucked behind a loose stone near the mechanism. His gnarled fingers, accustomed to the cold metal of the lens, trembled slightly as he retrieved it.\n\nUnfurling the parchment, Elias found not a nautical chart, but a tapestry of stars. Constellations he’d never seen twisted across the surface, nebulae bloomed like spilled ink, and at their heart, a single, shimmering destination pulsed with an 'X' of pure, incandescent light. It wasn't drawn with ink, but woven from light itself, each line a thread of phosphorescence that seemed to whisper of impossible distances. A tremor, not of the sea, but of profound, earth-shattering wonder, ran through him. Fifty years of predictable darkness and unwavering light had built a solid world, and this map, this impossible artifact, had just shattered it. Was this a guide? A summons? A cosmic joke?\n\nHe felt a dizzying cocktail of fear and exhilaration. His predictable existence, the quiet dignity of his solitary post, suddenly felt like a cage he hadn't known he was in. This map sang a siren song of the unknown, of journeys beyond the horizon, beyond the sky. As his fingers brushed against the glowing 'X', the lighthouse itself seemed to sigh. The great lamp above flickered, its steady beam wavering for a disorienting second, mirroring the pulse of the map. Elias looked from the celestial chart to the churning sea below, then back to the impossible stars. The 'X' beckoned, a destination calling not from a place, but from a destiny. He knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that his fifty years of watching the sea were over. Now, he had to navigate the stars.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
