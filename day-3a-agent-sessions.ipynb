Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving areas of AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Genomics and Multi-omics Integration:** AI is becoming incredibly sophisticated at analyzing massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and other \"omics\" fields. This allows researchers to identify novel biological targets for diseases that were previously intractable or poorly understood.\n    *   **Development:** AI models can sift through millions of genetic variations and protein interactions to pinpoint specific genes or proteins that are crucial in disease pathways and are \"druggable\" (meaning a drug can be designed to interact with them).\n*   **Predicting Disease Causality:** Beyond correlation, AI is being used to infer causal relationships between biological factors and diseases, leading to more confident target selection.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design and Generation:**\n\n*   **Generative AI for Molecules:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of screening vast libraries of existing compounds, generative AI models (like Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, and Variational Autoencoders - VAEs) can *design entirely new molecules* with desired properties from scratch.\n    *   **Development:** Researchers can specify desired characteristics (e.g., high binding affinity to a target, low toxicity, good oral bioavailability), and the AI will generate novel chemical structures that are predicted to meet those criteria. This drastically expands the chemical space available for drug discovery.\n*   **Optimizing Molecular Properties:** AI can then iteratively refine these newly designed molecules, optimizing them for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body).\n\n**3. Accelerating Preclinical Development:**\n\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are being trained to predict how well a potential drug will work and what its side effects might be *before* expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments or clinical trials.\n    *   **Development:** This includes predicting ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) properties, a critical bottleneck in drug development.\n*   **Virtual Screening Enhancement:** While de novo design is powerful, AI also enhances traditional virtual screening by more intelligently prioritizing which existing compounds to test.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Execution:**\n\n*   **Patient Selection for Trials:** AI can analyze patient data to identify individuals who are most likely to respond to a particular drug or to have a specific disease subtype, leading to more targeted and efficient clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success Rates:** AI models can help predict the likelihood of success for a given drug candidate in clinical trials, allowing for better resource allocation and risk management.\n*   **Identifying Biomarkers:** AI can help discover novel biomarkers that can predict treatment response or disease progression, leading to more personalized trial designs.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of biological and chemical data to identify existing drugs that could be effective against new diseases. This is a much faster and cheaper approach than developing a drug from scratch.\n\n**Key Players and Trends:**\n\n*   **AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** A surge of startups (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Atomwise, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine) are building their entire drug discovery pipelines around AI platforms.\n*   **Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are actively partnering with these AI firms or investing heavily in their own internal AI capabilities.\n*   **Focus on Specific Diseases:** Many AI-driven drug discovery efforts are currently focused on areas with high unmet needs, such as neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), rare diseases, and certain types of cancer.\n\n**In essence, AI is moving drug discovery from a process of trial-and-error and serendipity to a more rational, predictive, and data-driven science. This has the potential to significantly shorten drug development timelines, reduce costs, and bring life-saving therapies to patients much faster.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **second major development I mentioned: \"De Novo Drug Design and Generation\"**. This is indeed one of the most groundbreaking aspects of AI in drug discovery right now.\n\nLet's dive deeper into what it means and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is \"De Novo Drug Design\"?**\n\n\"De novo\" is a Latin phrase meaning \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" In the context of drug discovery, **de novo drug design refers to the process of creating entirely new molecular structures that have never existed before, with the specific goal of interacting with a particular biological target to treat a disease.**\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n*   **Traditional Drug Discovery (screening):** This is like searching through a massive existing library of books to find one that contains a specific piece of information. You're limited to what's already been written.\n*   **De Novo Drug Design (AI-generated):** This is like asking an incredibly intelligent author to *write a brand new book* from scratch, perfectly tailored to convey the exact information you need.\n\n**How AI Enables De Novo Design:**\n\nThis capability is largely driven by a class of AI algorithms called **Generative Models**. The most prominent ones used in de novo drug design include:\n\n1.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**\n    *   **How they work:** GANs consist of two neural networks that compete against each other: a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**.\n        *   The **Generator** tries to create new molecular structures that look like real drugs.\n        *   The **Discriminator** tries to distinguish between real drug molecules and the ones generated by the Generator.\n    *   **Outcome:** Through this adversarial process, the Generator gets progressively better at creating realistic and novel molecular structures that are chemically valid and potentially active.\n\n2.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**\n    *   **How they work:** VAEs learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of existing molecules. They then learn to map points in this latent space back to molecular structures.\n    *   **Outcome:** By sampling points from the latent space and decoding them, VAEs can generate new, but similar, molecular structures. They are good at exploring the chemical space around known drug-like molecules.\n\n3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**\n    *   **How it's used:** RL can be combined with generative models. The AI is trained to achieve specific \"rewards\" (e.g., high binding affinity to a target, good predicted toxicity profile). The AI learns a policy to generate molecules that maximize these rewards.\n\n**Key Features and Advantages of AI-Driven De Novo Design:**\n\n*   **Exploring Novel Chemical Space:** Generative models can explore chemical structures that human chemists might not conceive of or find through traditional methods. This can lead to entirely new classes of drugs.\n*   **Designing for Specific Targets:** Instead of randomly finding a molecule that *might* hit a target, AI can be guided to design molecules that are optimized to bind with high affinity and specificity to a chosen disease-related protein or molecule.\n*   **Optimizing Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** Modern de novo design tools can be trained to optimize for several desirable drug properties at once, not just target binding. This includes:\n    *   **Efficacy:** How well it works.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Binding only to the intended target, minimizing off-target effects.\n    *   **Pharmacokinetics (ADMET):** How the body handles the drug (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity).\n    *   **Synthesizability:** How easy it is to actually create the molecule in a lab.\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** By generating promising candidates much faster than traditional screening, AI can significantly shorten the early stages of drug discovery.\n\n**Challenges and Limitations:**\n\n*   **Synthesizability:** While AI can design molecules, it's crucial that they can actually be synthesized in a laboratory. Ensuring chemical feasibility is an ongoing area of research.\n*   **Validation:** The molecules generated by AI still need rigorous experimental validation. AI is a powerful tool for *generating hypotheses*, not for replacing the scientific process of testing.\n*   **Data Quality:** The performance of generative models heavily relies on the quality and quantity of the training data (existing drug molecules, protein structures, experimental results).\n*   **Explainability:** Understanding *why* an AI generated a particular molecule can sometimes be challenging, making it harder to trust or further refine the design process.\n\n**In summary, de novo drug design powered by generative AI is a paradigm shift in drug discovery. It moves beyond searching existing chemical libraries to actively creating new molecular entities specifically engineered to address unmet medical needs, with the potential to unlock novel therapeutic avenues.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven de novo drug design is vibrant and growing rapidly.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
